  <p>I spent a large part of my time in this semester of college studying Coptic, the language of Egypt before Arabization and last descendant of the heiroglyphic Egyptian that everyone knows about. The language is almost entirely dead, and regardless of whether or not there are remaining speakers, only the Bohairic dialect has survived even into the past few hundred years (to my knowledge), while I studied Sahidic.</p>
<p>The first thing that often comes up in discussions of learning dead languages, in my experience, is being told that they aren&rsquo;t useful because there is no community to speak with, and therefore that the student is wasting their time by studying them. This is of course easily dismissed, as there is (to me) obvious value in being able to read the literature of past eras without the interference of a translator; to me this is in fact the primary purpose of studying such a language. When I signed up to take the course in coptic I was largely interested in being able to read the writings of some of the earliest Christian monks in their native tongue and the texts of the Nag Hammadi library (though these are translations from Greek, the originals remain lost and so they are the least obscured versions we have).</p>
<p>Yet while the translator may no longer be coming between us and the author of the work, the lexicographer still generally is. Especially for one just beginning in a language, there is a great deal of trust placed in those who compile dictionaries. This trust is even stronger when studying a language like Coptic, for which only one really authoritative lexicon has ever been compiled. This is especially clear in the study of adpositions. Adpositions seem, to me, to be incredibly tricky to translate between languages even when they&rsquo;re closely related to eachother; the problem becomes much harder as the distance between the languages (in space or time) grows. To take an example from Coptic, what is the semantic difference between the two adpositions <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ϩⲁϩⲧⲏ<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ϩⲁϩⲧⲟⲟⲧ<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? My teacher and my lexicon tell me that they both simply mean beside, and while this may suffice for the purpose of translation, their different etymologies (both are derived by compounding the adposition ϩⲁ, meaning under, with a body part, either ϩⲧⲏ, stomach, or ⲧⲟⲟⲧ, hand), along with previous experience in semantics showing that true synonyms are very rare, leads me to believe that there is some more subtle distinction being drawn here which we simply don&rsquo;t have the right type of data to grasp what this distinction is. And even for words with meanings one can figure out pretty well (e.g. ϩⲟⲟⲩⲧⲥϩⲓⲙⲉ, transparently a calque of Greek ανδρογυνος), how am I to know how what the author of the text understood by &ldquo;androgyny&rdquo; or (more importantly) what those around them would have understood by it compares with what I understand by the word?</p>
<p>And the problem extends beyond the meanings of individual words to the meaning of grammar as well. What is the semantic content of the delayed subject construction using the prefix ⲛϭⲓ? Why do scribes sometimes write third person predicate nominative sentences with the copula(ish word, it&rsquo;s complicated) at the end and sometimes in the middle? The answer that is given to me by my professor (a wonderful teacher, but one who teaches religion rather than linguistics) is that these structures have no meaning, but just like how there is no such thing as a language with truly &ldquo;free&rdquo; word order, I don&rsquo;t believe that all these different constructions could exist without conveying something different to the people speaking the language at the time. We already know that Coptic has constructions meant to emphasize certain parts of a sentence, thinking that it has structures like this to direct emphasis in other ways seems like it should be totally uncontroversial. Still, we don&rsquo;t have enough of the right kind of data to know for sure, and we&rsquo;ll never be able to gather it either because the last speaker of Sahidic died centuries ago.</p>
<p>All this is simply to say that it somewhat saddens me that when learning a dead language, we can never really hope to achieve the same level of fluency that we might through speaking a living language, and that attempts at revitalizing previously dead languages can never (even if they succeed on some level) reclaim a language exactly as it was when it died. It doesn&rsquo;t help of course that even for languages whose corpora are large enough that we may hope to achieve a level of fluency (e.g. Latin or Greek, as well as Sanskrit which I won&rsquo;t talk about further simply because I know very little of Sanskrit pedagogy) the methods of teaching them often don&rsquo;t take advantage of what little we know for certain about language learning. Instead of giving the student as much comprehensible input as possible, they simply teach the grammar of the language so that the student can understand on a conscious level what is going on and has the ability to dissect the grammar of a text. But, as any linguist can tell you, this is far from being able to read or speak or understand a language. Oftentimes learners will become incredibly discouraged because of this, and it leads to fewer people being able to share in the appreciation of the literature, culture and history tied to these languages. For some languages there are of course better resources out there now, which focus on giving input and avoiding explanations of grammar in the native language of the learner, but they have yet to be widely adopted in teaching (at least here in amerika). For other smaller languages though, no such resources exist. In my Coptic class for example, I still spend much of my homework time translating isolated utterances using a small set of weekly vocabulary words, with reading continuous text taking up only a small portion of this work. It&rsquo;s particularly hard in Coptic of course, as the language never developed (as far as we know) the same sort of native linguistic tradition that Sanskrit or Greek or Latin did. There are no grammatical treatises about Coptic in Coptic, no discussions of proper spelling and pronunciation. And indeed this is true for all phases of the Egyptian language stretching back to the first hieroglyphs.</p>
<p>Related to this, I&rsquo;ve recently been contemplating trying to put together an open access Coptic textbook of my own, taking advantage of the corpus of actual Coptic text available at the <a href="https://copticscriptorium.org/">Coptic Scriptorium</a>, and with grammar explanations in Coptic itself as much as possible (though without words for nouns, verbs, and the like I would have to resort to using Greek loanwords, itself an integral part of the Coptic language), but I understand that such a project is altogether too ambitious for one student to tackle, so the idea will probably simply stew in my head until (hopefully) I have the time, resources, and skill to act on it better. In the meantime though I&rsquo;m going to simply continue augmenting my professor&rsquo;s instruction with composing short texts of my own and reading the Sahidic new testament outside of class as much as I can.</p>
