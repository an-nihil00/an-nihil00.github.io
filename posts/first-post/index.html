  <p>Today I got this site up and running using Hugo. I&rsquo;m mainly hoping to use it as a place to write about my experiences working on my projects, and to put info about those projects. Of course, I might also use it as a dumping ground for my other writing but we&rsquo;ll just have to see.</p>
<p>I wrote this theme myself, and its the first time I&rsquo;ve really gotten to make good use of all the html 5 semantic tags and role attributes. Previously I was vaguely aware they existed, but I hadn&rsquo;t had a project that really fit the typical document structure they describe so this was my first chance to use them. I had sort of hoped when I first learned about them that they&rsquo;d encourage people to write HTML that was actually somewhat readable rather than a mess od unnecessary div tags, but sadly that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case. At the very least I&rsquo;m glad that they apparently improve accesibility (I wouldn&rsquo;t know of course, I&rsquo;m not someone with a screenreader).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a big fan of lightweight, static sites. That&rsquo;s partly because of nostalgia for sitting at my old XP desktop tinkering with html and css in notepad without having to worry about servers or templating, but I also just think they work really well for a lot of what websites <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/"><em>should</em></a> be used for. And this has certainly met my needs in that regard. This page, even with my (sinful) use of font awesome and a web font (because god forbid users not read my text in my favorite font), still only comes out around 300 Kb. While I could probably do better I think its worth it for the convenience. The only downside I&rsquo;ve encountered so far is that theres no good way for me to make the navbar at the top of this page &ldquo;responsive&rdquo; without javascript, and since I&rsquo;ve been told over and over how important that apparently is, I might eventually cave there.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope to post many cool things to this site in the future!</p>
